\resumesection{Research Interests}

My research focuses on advancing human-robot interaction through improved experimental methodologies and accessible research tools. I am particularly interested in Wizard-of-Oz experimental frameworks, reproducibility in HRI studies, and developing platforms that democratize access to HRI research across disciplines. My work with HRIStudio addresses critical challenges in experimental reproducibility and cross-platform robot control, enabling researchers without specialized programming expertise to conduct rigorous HRI studies. I am passionate about exploring how we can make robot behaviors more trustworthy and explainable, particularly through transparent experimental design and comprehensive data logging. Looking forward, I aim to investigate how standardized experimental frameworks can advance our understanding of human-robot trust, collaboration dynamics, and the design of intuitive robot interfaces across diverse application domains.
