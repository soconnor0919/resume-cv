\resumesection{Research Interests}

I'm passionate about human-robot interaction and developing technologies that make robots better collaborators with humans. My work focuses on creating reproducible research methodologies, particularly through Wizard-of-Oz experiments, and building platforms that lower barriers for HRI researchers. I'm especially interested in how we can make robot behaviors more trustworthy and explainable, and how to design effective frameworks for studying human-robot collaboration across different contexts and applications.
